        "When rummaging through data, we were perplexed to noice a surprisingly low correlation between masking and COVID cases and deaths per capita over the pandemic up to May 31, 2021. In other words, states that masked more didn't seem to have more or less COVID cases and deaths, bucking conventional narratives. Though preliminary, this result gets at the importance of data in public policy, as it allows us to see where the reality on the ground diverges with our preconceived intuitions."

This analysis is important for two reasons: first, because historical understanding is always useful for informing a mental model of the world; and second, because answering these questions could directly contribute to future pandemic preparedness, saving lives. There are lots of narratives floating around COVID; let's see what the data has to say."
